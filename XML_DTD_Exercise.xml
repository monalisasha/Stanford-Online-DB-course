//Q1. In this question, you are to create a DTD for a small XML data set drawn from the Stanford course catalog. 
There are multiple departments, each with a department chair, some courses, and professors and/or lecturers who teach courses.

<!ELEMENT Course_Catalog (Department)*>
<!ELEMENT Department (Title, Chair, Course*)>
<!ATTLIST Department Code CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST Course Number CDATA #REQUIRED Enrollment CDATA #IMPLIED>
<!ELEMENT Chair (Professor)>
<!ELEMENT Professor (First_Name, Middle_Initial?, Last_Name)>
<!ELEMENT First_Name (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Middle_Initial (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Last_Name (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Course (Title, Description?, Instructors, Prerequisites?)>
<!ELEMENT Title (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Description (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Instructors (Lecturer|Professor)*>
<!ELEMENT Lecturer (First_Name, Middle_Initial?, Last_Name)>
<!ELEMENT Prerequisites (Prereq)*>
<!ELEMENT Prereq (#PCDATA)>

//Q2. In this question, you are to create a DTD for a different version of the data set drawn from the Stanford course catalog. 
This version encodes the data using ID and IDREF(S) attributes.
Hint: You may want to use your DTD from the previous question as a starting point, since the structure is similar.

<!ELEMENT Course_Catalog (Department)*>
<!ATTLIST Department Code ID #REQUIRED Chair IDREF #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT Department (Title, Course*, (Professor|Lecturer)*)>

<!ELEMENT Courseref (#PCDATA)>

<!ELEMENT First_Name (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Middle_Initial (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Last_Name (#PCDATA)>

//Q3. In this question, you are to create a DTD for a small XML data set about world countries. 
This data is adapted from the Mondial 3.0 database as hosted by the University of Washington, and was originally compiled by 
the Georg-August University of Goettingen Institute for Informatics. Each country has a name, population, and area (in sq. km). 
Some countries also list languages (with percentages of the population that speaks each language) and/or cities (with names and populations). 

<!ELEMENT countries (country)*>
<!ELEMENT country ((city*|language*)?)*>
<!ELEMENT city (name, population)>
<!ATTLIST country name CDATA #REQUIRED population CDATA #REQUIRED area CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST language percentage CDATA #IMPLIED>
<!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT population (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT language (#PCDATA)>
